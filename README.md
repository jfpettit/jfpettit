# Welcome! 👋

👨‍💻 I'm Jacob Pettit, and I work on reinforcement learning research. My GitHub account houses my personal projects. 

## Right now I'm excited about:

- 🤖 Multiagent RL. Both collaborative and competitive.
- 💪 Robust RL. Can we make RL handle changes in its environment, such as noise in observations and in environment dynamics?
- 🧬 Sequence optimization. Think DNA/RNA/amino acid optimization and mathematical expression optimization.
- 💉 mRNA vaccines (and the COVID vaccine)!

## I'm currently exploring:

- 💨 `jit`-able RL environments
- 🐈 Quantum ML

## I'm learning about:

- 🔬 Biology - Protein folding, mRNA, and the COVID vaccine! DeepMind's AlphaFold release and the exciting science of the COVID vaccine inspired me to learn more about them.
- 💻 JavaScript, JAX in Python, and SWE best practices.
